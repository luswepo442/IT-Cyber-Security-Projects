## Project List

### Project 1: Understanding and Mitigating SQL Injection Attacks

**Description:**  
This project focused on conducting a lab exercise on SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks, specifically emphasizing password bypass attacks. SQL Injection involves manipulating a web application's input fields to execute unauthorized SQL commands.

**Tools Used:**  
- Cisco virtual environments

**Findings:**  
- Successfully executed an SQL Injection password bypass attack.
- Analyzed reasons behind SQLi occurrences and methods to mitigate them effectively.

### Project 2: Remote Shell Extracting Data

**Description:**  
This project delved into social engineering and remote shell exploitation, focusing on embedding a remote shell malware into a program and executing it via social engineering tactics.

**Tools Used:**  
- Cisco virtual environments
- Kali Linux
- Metasploit

**Findings:**  
- Insertion of a meterpreter payload into a vulnerable program.
- Successful execution of a social engineering attack.
- Deployment and exploitation of a remote shell.
